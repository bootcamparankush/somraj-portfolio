# somraj-portfolio
My portfolio highlights the strongest work I have accomplished and has content for additional details about the work I have done so far in my career. I have created this webpage from the learings that I have been taught the first couple of weeks of the coding bootcamp.

I addition, I plan to enhance my portfolio with frequent updates with additional coding lessons such as Javascript etc to create more applications. In the long run, the intended function of this portfolio page is for employers to be able to be able to review my skills and also check sample projects that I have successfully deployed through my portfolio webside. See below as screen shot the my portfolio web page that I deployed on github.

I have also provided direct links to my resume, linkedin profile, contact details. See below a screen shot of the webpage I developed.
